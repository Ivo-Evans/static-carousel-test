HTML and CSS:
- import images
- check that they display in a column/row on both stylesheets
- stack images one on top of the other so that only one displays (optional?)
- create two classes, one with display: none, one which displays
- set all but the first image to display: none, with classes
- create right/left buttons
- check all is displaying well, on both mobile and desktop

JavaScript:
- create index tracking variable, initialised to 0.
- write function that: 
  - iterates through every image, setting them all to display: none;
  - sets the image at the index provided as an argument to display
  - sets the index-tracking variable to whatever number is provided to the function
- add event handlers associated with left and right buttons that call the above function with current index plus or minus 1
